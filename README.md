## salt-osx ##

SaltStack grains, modules, and states to manage Mac OS X.

The motivation for this repository is to provide SaltStack modules that call native API through PyObjC, in addition
to command line tools. This gives a greater level of control than executing commands by themselves, which is what
puppet, chef etc. are doing.

*WARNING:* A lot of modules are in a very early state of development, check the list below to see which are usable.

## Installation ##

**VERY IMPORTANT:** You must disable multiprocessing on the Mac OS X minions for CoreFoundation modules to work. This is
because salt-minion threading does not work **at all** with CoreFoundation API. If you do not do this, the minion will 
crash without warning when trying to execute some modules. This is not the case with `salt-call` as it does not seem to 
use multiple threads. Modules using the CoreFoundation API are listed below, marked with **CF**.

If you do use any of these modules you must edit your minion configuration file,
usually `/etc/salt/minion` to include the following line:

    multiprocessing: False
    
This repository can then be added to your `file_roots` or whichever fileserver backend you happen to be using for your
master or masterless setup.

## Grains ##

- **filevault_enabled** FileVault state, True or False.
- **mac_admin_users** List of users in the local admin group.
- **mac_current_user** Currently logged in user.
- **mac_has_wireless** AirPort or WiFi device enabled, True or False.
- **mac_java_vendor** JRE vendor (Apple or Oracle)
- **mac_java_version** JRE version string
- **mac_laptop** 'mac_desktop' or 'mac_laptop', indicating the hardware type.
- **mac_timezone** Current system timezone.

## TODO ##

General Roadmap Notes:

- SaltStack Shortcomings:
    + **services**: launchctl.py enumeration of standard directories could potentially be faster through other API
    methods. If i want to be really pedantic then `restart()` doesnt need the `-w` flag for overrides.
    + **user**: mac_user.py Badly needs ShadowHash implementation similar to macadmin in ruby.
    + **pkg**: brew.py/macports.py No implementation for `installer` tool? Steal another implementation just so that
    Salt could be used to bootstrap other package management solutions.
    + **netstat**: No netstat implementation for osx
    + **ps**: No ps implementation for osx
    
- Stuff that should be parity with macadmin:
    + computer/computer group records (DSLocal)
    + authorization db
    + everything and anything that relates to profile installation

- Need to support configuration profile management including generation and remote enrollment.
